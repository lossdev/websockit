// package websockit aims to provide a toolkit to quickly and easily get started with a websocket server, client, or both
// with built in connection and error handling.

// Traditionally, implementing either end of a websocket pair can be a tricky task that requires a lot of boilerplate and
// docs reading. websockit aims to try and eliminate the most downtime from this process as possible by providing a lot of
// the generic framework around websockets.
